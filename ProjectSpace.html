            <h1>Universe:-</h1>
            <p>Have you ever wondered what is outside the Earth? Is Earth all there is? Are there other planets? Where
                is the sun found and the moon? All these questions bring you to the topic of outer space!
                Outer Space or Space refers to more or less everything outside the Earth's Atmosphere. It begins at a
                point known as the Kármán Line (100km from Earth) and extends beyond it. Space is also scientifically
                known as the Universe.
                Outer Space is completely dark. It is pitch black. Why so? The reason for that is that there is no air
                in outer space.
                Since there is no air outside the Earth's Atmosphere there is no air to scatter sunlight thus no colours
                can be formed.</p>
